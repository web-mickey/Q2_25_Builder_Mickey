# Dexera

This project is a community-driven decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Solana blockchain. It allows users to create on-chain profiles that come with a unique referral fee mechanism. Whenever a swap is executed using a userâ€™s referral link, a portion of the protocol fee is redirected to that user. In contrast to existing Solana DEXs like Raydium or Pump.fun, where the entire fee goes to the protocol, this model shares revenue with the community.
